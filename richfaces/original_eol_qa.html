<h1>RichFaces End-Of-Life Questions & Answers</h1>
(The RichFaces project will reach its end of life in June 2016)
<h2>What will happen to RichFaces resources?</h2>
<p>
All resources are staying where they are; we will still host the documentation, downloads and the RichFaces Showcase.
</p>

<h2>What will happen if a serious bug or security issue is discovered in the future?</h2>
<p>
There will be no patches after the end of support. In case of discovering a serious issue you will have to develop a patch yourself or switch to another framework.
</p>

<h2>Can we keep using RichFaces or should we switch to another framework?</h2>
<p>There’s no immediate need to switch. Apart from the core codebase upgrading third-party libraries (jQuery, CKEditor, …) is fairly straightforward so you can keep your project up-to-date. However if you encounter any bugs you will have to patch the source code yourself or switch to another framework.</p>

<h2>Do you have a recommendation for a framework we should switch to?</h2>
<p>There is no direct replacement for RichFaces so you will need to change your code to make it work with the new framework. You can choose from any JSF-based frameworks that are still active.</p>

<p>Another option but considerably more difficult in terms of migrating your code is to switch to any of the modern frameworks that are leveraging HTML5 and JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Is there a way to keep RichFaces maintained?</h2>
<p>You are free to fork the project and keep working on it.</p>
